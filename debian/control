Description: Generates an index (or tag) file of names found in source files
 A continuation of the exuberant-ctags implementation of the ctags
 program. Ctags generates an index (or tag) file of language objects
 found in source files that allows these items to be quickly and
 easily located by a text editor or other utility. A tag signifies a
 language object for which an index entry is available (or,
 alternatively, the index entry created for that object).
